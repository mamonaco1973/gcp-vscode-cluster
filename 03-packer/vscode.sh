# vscode.sh - code-server Installation and PAM Wiring
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   - Installs code-server (open-source VS Code server) into the custom image.
#   - Wires a PAM stack so the broker can authenticate AD users via SSSD.
#   - Creates the node-local state root used for per-user editor state.
#
# Design Note:
#   code-server is a SINGLE-user process with a shared-password auth model.
#   It is deliberately NOT enabled as a system service here. The broker
#   (see broker.sh) starts one instance per logged-in user via systemd-run,
#   bound to loopback only. Enabling it globally would give every user the
#   same identity and the same home directory.

# Extension gallery — Open VSX, deliberately
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a licensing boundary, not a preference. code-server is MIT, but
# Microsoft's Marketplace terms permit access only from official Microsoft
# products, so pointing EXTENSIONS_GALLERY there would make a lawful build
# unlawful without changing a line of code.
#
# Open VSX is code-server's default; setting it explicitly means a future
# override has to be a deliberate act rather than an unnoticed default.
# Extensions missing from Open VSX go through /nfs/extensions as VSIX files
# obtained from their publishers — never scraped from the Marketplace.

# Extension auto-update is OFF deliberately. Every workbench load otherwise
# queries the gallery, which leaves the node through Cloud NAT; a slow
# or hanging lookup stalls the extension host and the editor stops responding
# for as long as it takes. Users can still install and update on demand.
